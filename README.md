### Prerequisites
Before you install the project, make sure you have npm installed for running the frontend and a basic shell environment for executing scripts for the backend.

### Installing and Running the Frontend
Navigate to the frontend directory of the project and run the following commands:

```bash
cd frontend    # Go to frontend directory
npm install    # Install dependencies
npm start      # Start the React application
```
This will set up the frontend part of WhisPath, which will be available on http://localhost:3000.

### Setting Up and Running the Backend
